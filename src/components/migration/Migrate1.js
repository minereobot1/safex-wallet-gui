          In this phase you will go through the steps in order to migrate your
          Safe Exchange coins from the bitcoin blockchain to the Safex
          blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is irreversible and you should do so acknowledging that
          any mistakes made during this process can and definitely may result in
          total loss of your Safe Exchange Coins and also your Safex Tokens and
          Safex Cash Airdrop. Proceed with absolute care, and follow the
          procedures carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please do consult the https://safe.exchange forum if you have any
          questions. You can email the Safex Team directly if something is
          unclear. There will be fees involved that go to the Bitcoin Network in
          order to facilitate the transactions; These are not provided by the
          Safex Team and no one but yourself is obligated to have the necessary
          Bitcoin Fees covered on your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          This procedure will last only for 1 year, until Block 1,000,000, after
          this time no Safe Exchnage Coins will be transferable. And any Airdrop
          will be absorbed by the Safex Developers.
